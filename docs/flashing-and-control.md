# Connecting the Code to the Car

You've built the circuit. This is how you get the code onto the ESP32 and drive
the car. Plan on about 15 minutes the first time.

## Step 1 — Install the Arduino IDE

Download and install it from <https://www.arduino.cc/en/software>. Open it once
so it finishes setting up.

## Step 2 — Add ESP32 board support

1. **File → Preferences.**
2. In **Additional boards manager URLs**, paste:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
   ```
   Click OK.
3. **Tools → Board → Boards Manager**, search **esp32**, install **esp32 by
   Espressif Systems**. (This download is large; let it finish.)

## Step 3 — Install the servo library

**Tools → Manage Libraries**, search **ESP32Servo**, install it.

## Step 4 — Pick which firmware to use

There are two versions. **Flash only one.**

| Folder | Control method | Use this if... |
|---|---|---|
| `firmware/rc_car_classic/` | Bluetooth Classic | You'll drive it from a phone "Bluetooth terminal" app (simplest) |
| `firmware/rc_car_ble/` | Bluetooth Low Energy | You want the on-screen web remote (`app/index.html`) |

For most people, start with **rc_car_classic**.

Open it: **File → Open**, navigate to `firmware/rc_car_classic/` and open
`rc_car_classic.ino`. (Each sketch lives in its own folder — open the `.ino`,
not the folder.)

## Step 5 — Plug in and pick the board + port

1. Connect the ESP32 to your computer with a **data** USB cable (some cables are
   charge-only — if the board never shows up, try another cable).
2. **Tools → Board → esp32 →** select **ESP32 Dev Module**.
3. **Tools → Port →** select the COM port that appears when you plug the board
   in (e.g. `COM5`). If no new port appears, install the **CP2102 driver** (this
   board uses a CP2102 USB chip) from Silicon Labs.
4. Leave the other Tools settings at their defaults.

## Step 6 — Upload

1. Click the **Upload** button (the right-arrow ➜).
2. It compiles, then flashes. If it stalls at `Connecting....`, **hold the BOOT
   button** on the ESP32 for a couple seconds while it connects, then release.
3. Wait for **Done uploading.**

## Step 7 — Confirm it's alive

1. **Tools → Serial Monitor**, set the baud rate (bottom right) to **115200**.
2. Press the ESP32's **EN/RST** button. You should see:
   ```
   RC car ready.
   Pair with Bluetooth device: ESP32_RC_Car
   ```
   If you see that, the code is running.

## Step 8 — Connect your phone and drive

1. On your phone, install any **Bluetooth terminal / serial** app (e.g.
   "Serial Bluetooth Terminal" on Android).
2. In your phone's Bluetooth settings, **pair** with **ESP32_RC_Car**.
3. Open the terminal app, connect to `ESP32_RC_Car`, and send these:

   | Send | Does |
   |---|---|
   | `F` | forward |
   | `B` | backward |
   | `S` | stop |
   | `L` | steer left |
   | `R` | steer right |
   | `C` | center steering |
   | `V160` | set speed 0–255 |
   | `A95` | set steering angle 0–180 |

   The car **auto-stops after 1 second** with no command — that's intentional,
   so it doesn't run away if the phone disconnects. Keep sending while driving.

### (Optional) Web remote instead of a terminal app
If you flashed `rc_car_ble` instead, open `app/index.html` in **Chrome on
Android or desktop** (not iOS Safari — it can't do Web Bluetooth), tap
**Connect**, pick `ESP32_RC_Car`, and hold the on-screen buttons to drive.

## Step 9 — First drive checklist (do this with wheels off the ground)

Test in this order so a wiring mistake doesn't send the car off a table:

1. Servo only — send `A90`, `A60`, `A120`. Steering should move and center.
2. One motor — send `F` briefly, then `S`. Confirm it spins.
3. Both motors — `F`/`B`/`S`.
4. Steering + drive together.

## When something's wrong

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| No COM port shows up | Bad/charge-only cable, or missing CP2102 driver |
| Upload stuck at `Connecting...` | Hold **BOOT** during upload |
| `ESP32_RC_Car` not in Bluetooth list | You flashed the BLE version — it won't show in normal pairing; use the web remote. Or flash `rc_car_classic`. |
| A motor spins the wrong way | Swap that motor's two wires on the L298N |
| Steering reversed | Swap `leftAngle` / `rightAngle` in the code |
| Motors don't change speed with `V` | ENA/ENB jumpers still on the L298N — remove them |
| ESP32 resets when motors start | Add the 470–1000µF capacitor; don't power motors from the ESP32 |
| Motors don't move at all | Check the L298N ENA/ENB are wired (GPIO 4 / 5) and grounds are shared |

See [hardware-setup.md](hardware-setup.md) for the wiring those pins expect.
